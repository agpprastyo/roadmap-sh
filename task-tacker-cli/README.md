# Task Tracker CLI

This is a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) application built in Go for managing tasks. The application allows you to add, update, delete, and list tasks, as well as mark them as in-progress or done. Tasks are stored in a JSON file, making it easy to persist data between sessions.
